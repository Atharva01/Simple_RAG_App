# Simple RAG with Ollama, FAISS, and Streamlit

This project implements a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using:

- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) for running large language models and embeddings locally
- [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) for chaining prompts and retrieval
- [FAISS](https://faiss.ai/) for efficient vector similarity search
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the user interface

The application allows you to upload PDFs, build a vector index, and interact with your documents through natural language queries.
